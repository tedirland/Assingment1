<h1>Ted Irland's Wickedly Awesome Portfolio</h1>

<p>My Name is Ted Irland and I am an aspiring Software Developer. My career journey up to this point has been <em>evolving</em> to say the least.
    <br>

    I studied History and Spanish Language at Michigan State, hoping to go into the education field. During my time at MSU, I learned that I wasn't 100% passionate about becoming an educator. As most people who have no idea what they want to do often do, I took an entry level job at a large sales organization. Although sales was never something I was <em>truly</em> passionate about, I was good at it and learned much from some great leaders. I became a leader myself and went on to lead a very successful, if not fulfilling, 9 year career in the field. 
    <br>

    In my sales career, I recieved the most satisfaction solving problems. In my mind, there is no better way to slove today's most pressing problems than with technology.

    <br> 

    I work for Hired, which is a website that helps software developers find work. I asked my clients how they would recommend acquiring the skills I need to move into the software development field and the Trilogy bootcamp through Northwestern University came <strong> highly recommended!</strong>
