          <p> My name is Ted Irland and I am an aspiring software developer. I grew up in a small town in rural Michigan. The kind of town with more cows that people. I was raised by two educators and grew up thinking I'd like to teach myself someday. You know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men.
<br>
<br>
     I went to college to be a teacher, but learned along the way that I wasn't super passionate about teaching and that I was pretty good at talking to people. I joined a large sales organization out of school and have led a successful 9 year career in Software Sales. 
<br> 
<br>
     After nearly a decade slinging other people's software, I figured I'd acquire the skills to create some of my own.
