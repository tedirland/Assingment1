          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>My name is Ted Irland and I am an aspiring software developer. I grew up in a small town in rural Michigan. The kind of town with more cows that people. I was raised by two educators and grew up thinking I'd like to teach myself someday. You know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men.</p>

            <p>I went to college to be a teacher, but learned along the way that I wasn't super passionate about teaching and that I was pretty good at talking to people. I joined a large sales organization out of school and have led a successful 9 year career in Software Sales. <br> <br> After nearly a decade slinging other people's software, I figured I'd acquire the skills to create some of my own.    </p>
